          ## It's not working on my phone/computer?

          > Currently I know about a few issues with InternetExplorer and iOS. I'm trying to get iOS working as soon as possible. Until then you can use it on any desktop using Chrome or Firefox. Check back in the next few weeks and I hopefully will have it working!

          ## Should I follow the pattern exactly?

          > The website does its best to try and create a great cross stitch from any image, however its not always perfect. Feel free to use your best judgement and alter your pattern after it has been generated.

          ---

          ## Why doesn't my pattern match the sizes I selected?

          > StitchPics does its best to match the pattern size you requested, however sometimes the site needs to adjust the pattern options in order to fit your image perfectly.

          ## How can I get my image to look better?

          > There are a few ways to get your pattern to look better.

          > * Increasing the number of colors can add more "life" to your images.
          > * Increasing the cross stitch size can help smaller details show up in the image and can help increase the overall quality.
          > * Using a higher count Aida cloth can help get the most detail from an image.

          ## Why are the colors all wrong?

          > Try setting the number of colors a little higher. The site tries to pick the best colors for each image, but can look off when the number of colors is very low. You can always choose a larger number of colors and combine similar ones, or you can just pick a thread that is closer to what you orignally wanted instead of that color.

          ## How do I get the DMC color numbers/Can I add symbols to the pattern?

          > As of right now you can't, however I'm hard at work adding those features! Check back within the next week or so and they should be here.
