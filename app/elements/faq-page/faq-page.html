          ## It's not working on my phone/computer?

          > Currently it's not working on iOS (Sadly I don't have an iOS device to develop on).
          > I'm working on getting one so I can figure out the issues and get it working.

          ## What is the "cross stitch size" measurement?

          > This is the width of the image in inches. Because each picture you upload can be a
          > different shape, it will automatically calculate the height based on the width. So if
          > you upload a 3x5 image and set the "cross stitch size" to 3, the cross stitch will be
          > 3x5. If you upload that same 3x5 and set the "cross stitch size" to 6, the cross stitch
          > will be 6x10

          ## Should I follow the pattern exactly?

          > The website does its best to try and create a great cross stitch from any image, however
          > its not always perfect. Feel free to use your best judgement and alter your pattern
          > after it has been generated.

          ---

          ## Why doesn't my pattern match the sizes I selected?

          > StitchPics does its best to match the pattern size you requested, however sometimes the
          > site needs to adjust the pattern options in order to fit your image perfectly.

          ## How can I get my image to look better?

          > There are a few ways to get your pattern to look better.

          > * Increasing the number of colors can add more "life" to your images.
          > * Increasing the cross stitch size can help smaller details show up in the image and can help increase the overall quality.
          > * Using a higher count Aida cloth can help get the most detail from an image.

          ## Why are the colors all wrong?

          > Try setting the number of colors a little higher. The site tries to pick the best
          > colors for each image, but can look off when the number of colors is very low. You can
          > always choose a larger number of colors and combine similar ones, or you can just pick
          > a thread that is closer to what you orignally wanted instead of that color.

          ## Can I add symbols to the pattern?

          > As of right now you can't, however I'm hard at work adding this features! Check back
          > and hopefully it will be added at one point!
